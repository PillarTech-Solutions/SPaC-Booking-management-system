## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js 22+
- npm 10+
- A Supabase Project ([supabase.com](https://supabase.com))

### 2. Installation
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd spac-booking-management-system
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Copy the template environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Fill in your Supabase credentials in `.env`:
```ini
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### 4. Database Migrations
Deploy the version-controlled SQL migrations located in `supabase/migrations/` sequentially in your Supabase SQL Editor:
1. `20261016000001_core_schema.sql` (Tables, constraints, indexes, exclusion constraints)
2. `20261016000002_functions_and_triggers.sql` (Sequences, audit triggers, pricing functions)
3. `20261016000003_rls_policies.sql` (Row Level Security policies)
4. `20261016000004_initial_seed.sql` (Default court, pricing, settings, and admin provisioning)
5. `20261016000005_staff_management_rpc.sql` (Staff account creation RPC)
6. `20261016000006_auth_email_lookup.sql` (Login error distinction: unknown email vs incorrect password)

### 5. Staff Account Creation
The Accounts page calls the `create_staff_account_rpc` PostgreSQL function to create staff accounts. Ensure migration `20261016000005_staff_management_rpc.sql` has been applied to the same Supabase project configured in `.env`.

### 6. Verify Database Schema
Run the static migrations verification script:
```bash
npm run db:verify
```

### 7. Development Server
Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
